## Introduction

chip8 is a CHIP-8 emulator developed in C using the SDL2 multimedia library.
It emulates a standard CHIP-8 machine and implements all the opcodes that
the specification provides.

This emulator was initially developed by Dani Rodr√≠guez, danirod at GitHub.
It's developed as part of his [live coding streaming series on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTd5ehIj0goNh89DWAjXKCYxJQO0ZMxaE) where
a program is developed in a live streaming.
