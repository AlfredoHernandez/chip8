chip8 is a CHIP-8 emulator developed in C using the SDL2 multimedia library. It
emulates a standard CHIP-8 machine and implements all the opcodes that the
specification provides.

To emulate a binary ROM just provide the file as an argument:

    $ chip8 ~/roms/TETRIS.bin

You can have more information by reading the software manual at the following
locations:

* http://www.danirod.es/chip8/docs/current/manual/ (online manual).
* http://www.danirod.es/chip8/docs/current/chip8.pdf (PDF manual).

In order to compile this project you will need to have SDL 2.0 headers and
libraries in your machine. Head to www.libsdl.org to get those in case you
still haven’t got them or get them using your package manager if your operating
system has any.

After installing SDL 2.0 you can download the software distribution and install
it via the following commands:

    autoreconf --install  # Only if you are using the Git repository
    ./configure
    make
    make install
    make check  # Optional: to test the emulator -- libcheck is required
