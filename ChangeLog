	* src/sdl.c: Drop SDL_WINDOW_OPENGL so that SDL can decide
	the best graphics backend based on the user platform.
	* src/sdl.c: Remove unrequired SDL_Surface.

	* src/chip8.c: Fix bug where return status from SDL
	and context initialization functions was not checked for
	errors.	(Bug#2)
	* src/sdl.c: Rename error tags to exception tags to make
	them sound more pleasant.

	* chip8.c: Implement DRW opcode. This opcode will now plot
	pixels to the emulator screen, managed by an SDL window.
	* chip8.c: Implement opcodes related to keyboard. CHIP-8
	keyboard has 16 keys and they have been mapped to
	1234/QWER/ASDF/ZXCV.

2015-03-03  Dani Rodríguez  <danirod@outlook.com>

	Implement CHIP-8 opcodes exception keyboard input and screen
	output. The emulator now supports every opcode related to ALU
	and memory.
	* configure.ac: SDL 2.0 is now required to build the project.

2015-02-27  Dani Rodríguez  <danirod@outlook.com>

	Define CPU data structure and implement the main loop with
	placeholders that print to stdout each opcode dissassembled.
	* configure.ac: Create project structure.
