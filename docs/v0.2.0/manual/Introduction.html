<h2 class="chapter">1 Introduction</h2>

<p>Welcome to <em>chip8</em>, my implementation of an emulator compatible with the
CHIP-8 virtual machine. This software manual will bring you information about
the emulator, how to run programs on the CHIP-8, how to use the emulator and
some information for those interested on the insides of the CHIP-8 virtual
machine and the format used by the ROMs that can be run from CHIP-8.

<h3 class="section">1.1 Main features</h3>

<p>This implementation for the CHIP-8 virtual machine has, at this moment, the
following features:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Compatible with CHIP-8 and SUPERCHIP specifications.
</li><li> Modular, lightweight and fast.
</li><li> Multiplatform. Not only runs on GNU/Linux but also can be compiled on
Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg; and
Apple&reg; MacOS&reg; X.
</li><li> Virtually compatible with any machine by using the SDL2 library.
</li></ul>

<p>At this stage the emulator has not been finished. There are a few features
that have not been implemented yet. There is a particular interest in adding
the following features:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Support for the MEGACHIP specification.
</li><li> User defined settings.
</li><li> Development tools for writing ROMs.
</li></ul>

<h3 class="section">1.2 Reporting bugs</h3>

<p>This tool has not been finished yet, and therefore there might be issues that
haven&rsquo;t been reported or addressed yet. If during the execution of a program
you find some bug that would like to report for having it fixed, you can report
bugs to our issue tracker, at the canonical repository for our project. The
URL is <a href="https://www.github.com/danirod/chip8">https://www.github.com/danirod/chip8</a>.
</p>
<p>Please, provide as much information as you can, including the operating system
you are using, the version of the emulation software and if you can tell us
which ROM were you playing, it would be better.

<h3 class="section">1.3 Some history</h3>

<p>CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language and the specification for a
virtual machine. As is, CHIP-8 is not a cmoputer, and there are no computers
in the wild using this architecture, because it has limited resources. Instead
there are computers with their own hardware, that have a virtual machine that
allows the computer to decode and execute CHIP-8 programs.
</p>
<p>One of the first computers in add support for CHIP-8 as the COSMAC VIP, sold by
RCA in the late 70s. This computer had a processor made too by RCA, with a
speed of about 1.77 MHz and 2 kB of RAM memory. Inside the ROM, the operating
system had the CHIP-8 interpreter that allowed the system to run games using
the CHIP-8 language.
</p>
<p>However, there are more machines that have added support for CHIP-8, specially
during the late 80s and early 90s, with the expansion of small computers such
as graphical calculators. In fact, during this period and thanks to the first
Internet communities that came around that time, many hobbyists could extend
the original CHIP-8 specification, by making some changes that would make them
run better on their machines, and sometimes even improving the original CHIP-8
system, with features such as a bigger screen, more memory and even color.
</p>
<p>Thanks to being easy to understand, CHIP-8 is one of the greatest platforms
for those people who want to start working in the world of emulators
development, learning an easy architecture before starting bigger projects.
