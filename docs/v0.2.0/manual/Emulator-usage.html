<h3 class="section">2.1 Installing the emulator</h3>

<p>The main procedure for installing the emulator is to download the source
code distribution, compiling it and installing it. Of course, there are
aditional ways for obtaining the emulator, such as getting it from a binary
distribution, for example, a <em>.deb</em> file for Debian based systems or
an <em>.exe</em> application for Microsoft&reg;
Windows&reg;.
</p>
<p>This emulator only depends on SDL2, because it is the multimedia library used
for displaying the emulator output, reading keys from the keyboard and making
the speaker buzz. After the dependencies are met, this CHIP-8 emulator can be
installed by downloading the software release, extracting it somewhere, and
then running <code>./configure &amp;&amp; make</code> to compile it.
</p>
<p>Once compiled, it can be installed using <code>make install</code>. By default
on a standard GNU/Linux system they would be installed into
<samp>/usr/local/bin</samp>, <samp>/usr/local/share/doc/chip8</samp>, etc. On
Apple&reg; MacOS&reg; X systems, these locations
will be used as well. On Microsoft&reg;
Windows&reg;, the location might actually change depending on
how you build the software.
</p>
<p>If you are interested in checking that the software actually works as intended
you can use the test suite provided with the source distribution. In order to
run the tests you&rsquo;ll need to have <em>check</em> installed on your computer.
Install the dependencies, and then after running <code>./configure &amp;&amp; make</code>
on the emulator package, run <code>make check</code> to run the test suite.
After the execution, you will get a report on the test status.

<h3 class="section">2.2 Running the emulator</h3>

<p>After the emulator has been downloaded it can be executed using the command
<code>chip8 <var>file</var></code>, where <var>file</var> is the path to a binary file
that has the encoded data for a program that can run on the CHIP-8 virtual
machine.
</p>
<p>As an example, to run the ROM <samp>WIPEOFF.BIN</samp> using the emulator, the
following command can be used:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">$ chip8 WIPEOFF.BIN
</pre></div>

<p>assuming the game is on the current working directory. Some games can make use
of the buzzer that the CHIP-8 computer has. The buzzer will sound through the
speakers. If you want to avoid this behaviour you can run the game muted using
the <code>--mute</code> option:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">$ chip8 --mute WIPEOFF.BIN
</pre></div>

<p>There are actually two kinds of ROMs: binary ROMs and hexadecimal ROMs. A
binary ROM only has binary data and it is the most lightweight and fast way
for running a ROM because the data can be placed in memory and executed
instantaneously. This data can come from a dump for an actual CHIP-8 game or
a game made for the CHIP-8 platform in any other way
</p>
<p>However, to make easier to people to create their own ROMs, there is an
aditional way for running these ROMs and is using hexadecimal files. These
files are plain text files only having the characters <code>0-9</code>, <code>A-F</code>
and <code>a-f</code> encoded as either US-ASCII, UTF-8, Windows-1252 or a similar
human readable text-enconding and can be modified using any kind of text
editor that supports plain text. This format is slower to load since the
file has to be converted to binary but it makes playing around faster.

<h3 class="section">2.3 Using the emulator</h3>

<p>Once the emulator opens, it automatically starts executing the ROM contents.
It is possible to control the emulator using the emulated keyboard. The CHIP-8
specification sets a 16 keys keyboard using a 4x4 table having the following
layout:
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">[1] [2] [3] [C]
[4] [5] [6] [D]
[7] [8] [9] [E]
[A] [0] [B] [F]
</pre>
<p>Using the current settings, that aren&rsquo;t modifiable by the user yet &ndash;although
that is hoped for future releases, the assigned keys for the keyboard are
mapped to the following keys on a traditional keyboard:
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">[1] [2] [3] [4]
[Q] [W] [E] [R]
[A] [S] [D] [F]
[Z] [X] [C] [V]
</pre>
<p>Which means that if you want to send the <kbd>5</kbd> key to your game you should
press the <kbd>W</kbd> key in the emulator. Pressing <kbd>F</kbd> will trigger <kbd>E</kbd>
key and similar.
</p>
<p>During the execution of a CHIP-8 ROM, some games may play sounds on the buzzer.
As explained in <a href="#Running-the-emulator">Running the emulator</a>, this behaviour can be changed by
using the option <samp>--mute</samp> when running the game.

<h3 class="section">2.4 Stopping the emulation</h3>

<p>At this moment there is no way for pausing, resuming, resetting or stopping
the emulation in this CHIP-8 emulator. The only way for stopping it is by
exiting the emulator, something that you can do by pressing the Close button
on the emulator window. This depends on your window manager or operating
system.
