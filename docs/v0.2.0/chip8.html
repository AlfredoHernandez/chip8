<h3 class="section">1.3 Some history</h3>

<p>CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language and the specification for a
virtual machine. As is, CHIP-8 is not a cmoputer, and there are no computers
in the wild using this architecture, because it has limited resources. Instead
there are computers with their own hardware, that have a virtual machine that
allows the computer to decode and execute CHIP-8 programs.
</p>
<p>One of the first computers in add support for CHIP-8 as the COSMAC VIP, sold by
RCA in the late 70s. This computer had a processor made too by RCA, with a
speed of about 1.77 MHz and 2 kB of RAM memory. Inside the ROM, the operating
system had the CHIP-8 interpreter that allowed the system to run games using
the CHIP-8 language.
</p>
<p>However, there are more machines that have added support for CHIP-8, specially
during the late 80s and early 90s, with the expansion of small computers such
as graphical calculators. In fact, during this period and thanks to the first
Internet communities that came around that time, many hobbyists could extend
the original CHIP-8 specification, by making some changes that would make them
run better on their machines, and sometimes even improving the original CHIP-8
system, with features such as a bigger screen, more memory and even color.
</p>
<p>Thanks to being easy to understand, CHIP-8 is one of the greatest platforms
for those people who want to start working in the world of emulators
development, learning an easy architecture before starting bigger projects.

<a name="Installing-the-emulator-1"></a>
<h3 class="section">2.1 Installing the emulator</h3>

<p>The main procedure for installing the emulator is to download the source
code distribution, compiling it and installing it. Of course, there are
aditional ways for obtaining the emulator, such as getting it from a binary
distribution, for example, a <em>.deb</em> file for Debian based systems or
an <em>.exe</em> application for Microsoft&reg;
Windows&reg;.
</p>
<p>This emulator only depends on SDL2, because it is the multimedia library used
for displaying the emulator output, reading keys from the keyboard and making
the speaker buzz. After the dependencies are met, this CHIP-8 emulator can be
installed by downloading the software release, extracting it somewhere, and
then running <code>./configure &amp;&amp; make</code> to compile it.
</p>
<p>Once compiled, it can be installed using <code>make install</code>. By default
on a standard GNU/Linux system they would be installed into
<samp>/usr/local/bin</samp>, <samp>/usr/local/share/doc/chip8</samp>, etc. On
Apple&reg; MacOS&reg; X systems, these locations
will be used as well. On Microsoft&reg;
Windows&reg;, the location might actually change depending on
how you build the software.
</p>
<p>If you are interested in checking that the software actually works as intended
you can use the test suite provided with the source distribution. In order to
run the tests you&rsquo;ll need to have <em>check</em> installed on your computer.
Install the dependencies, and then after running <code>./configure &amp;&amp; make</code>
on the emulator package, run <code>make check</code> to run the test suite.
After the execution, you will get a report on the test status.

</div>
<a name="Running-the-emulator-1"></a>
<h3 class="section">2.2 Running the emulator</h3>

<p>After the emulator has been downloaded it can be executed using the command
<code>chip8 <var>file</var></code>, where <var>file</var> is the path to a binary file
that has the encoded data for a program that can run on the CHIP-8 virtual
machine.
</p>
<p>As an example, to run the ROM <samp>WIPEOFF.BIN</samp> using the emulator, the
following command can be used:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">$ chip8 WIPEOFF.BIN
</pre></div>

<p>assuming the game is on the current working directory. Some games can make use
of the buzzer that the CHIP-8 computer has. The buzzer will sound through the
speakers. If you want to avoid this behaviour you can run the game muted using
the <code>--mute</code> option:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">$ chip8 --mute WIPEOFF.BIN
</pre></div>

<p>There are actually two kinds of ROMs: binary ROMs and hexadecimal ROMs. A
binary ROM only has binary data and it is the most lightweight and fast way
for running a ROM because the data can be placed in memory and executed
instantaneously. This data can come from a dump for an actual CHIP-8 game or
a game made for the CHIP-8 platform in any other way
</p>
<p>However, to make easier to people to create their own ROMs, there is an
aditional way for running these ROMs and is using hexadecimal files. These
files are plain text files only having the characters <code>0-9</code>, <code>A-F</code>
and <code>a-f</code> encoded as either US-ASCII, UTF-8, Windows-1252 or a similar
human readable text-enconding and can be modified using any kind of text
editor that supports plain text. This format is slower to load since the
file has to be converted to binary but it makes playing around faster.

<a name="Using-the-emulator-1"></a>
<h3 class="section">2.3 Using the emulator</h3>

<p>Once the emulator opens, it automatically starts executing the ROM contents.
It is possible to control the emulator using the emulated keyboard. The CHIP-8
specification sets a 16 keys keyboard using a 4x4 table having the following
layout:
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">[1] [2] [3] [C]
[4] [5] [6] [D]
[7] [8] [9] [E]
[A] [0] [B] [F]
</pre>
<p>Using the current settings, that aren&rsquo;t modifiable by the user yet &ndash;although
that is hoped for future releases, the assigned keys for the keyboard are
mapped to the following keys on a traditional keyboard:
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">[1] [2] [3] [4]
[Q] [W] [E] [R]
[A] [S] [D] [F]
[Z] [X] [C] [V]
</pre>
<p>Which means that if you want to send the <kbd>5</kbd> key to your game you should
press the <kbd>W</kbd> key in the emulator. Pressing <kbd>F</kbd> will trigger <kbd>E</kbd>
key and similar.
</p>
<p>During the execution of a CHIP-8 ROM, some games may play sounds on the buzzer.
As explained in <a href="#Running-the-emulator">Running the emulator</a>, this behaviour can be changed by
using the option <samp>--mute</samp> when running the game.

exiting the emulator, something that you can do by pressing the Close button
on the emulator window. This depends on your window manager or operating
system.

<h2 class="chapter">3 Emulated systems</h2>

<p>This CHIP-8 emulator is compatible with other kinds of systems. CHIP-8 is based
in the origina lspecification written for the first computers using CHIP-8
virtual machines inside, such as the COSMAC VIP. However, through the years,
hobbyists interested in CHIP-8 emulation have developed emulators for other
kinds of machines such as calculators or PCs, and they have extended the
original specification for adding support to new features if the host hardware
allowed so.
</p>
<p>In particular, this emulator is at the moment compatible with CHIP-8 and
SUPERCHIP ROMs.

<h3 class="section">3.1 CHIP-8 platform</h3>

<p>This is the original platform for the CHIP-8 virtual machine. It is a simple
architecture that has the following hardware resources.
</p>
<ul>
<li> 4 kB of RAM memory.
</li><li> A register bank made of 16 registers, each one being 8 bits. These
    registers are refered to as <code>V0</code>, <code>V1</code>, ..., <code>V9</code>,
    <code>VA</code>, <code>VB</code>, <code>VC</code>, <code>VD</code>, <code>VE</code> and <code>VF</code>.
</li><li> A stack that can hold 16 16-bit values.
</li><li> A stack pointer for pointing to the next free location in the stack.
    As an example, if the stack pointer holds the value 5, that means
    that the next value pushed to the stack will be in the position 5.
    Pushing a value to the stack will increase the value of the stack pointer
    by 1 to make it point to the next free location. Popping something will
    decrease the value by 1, and then whatever is pointed by it, will be
    transfered to the target destination.
</li><li> A special register named I that is used by some operations such as
    painting to the screen.
</li></ul>

<p>The CHIP-8 screen is a rasterized 64 x 32 pixels display. It is monochrome
and up to 2048 pixels can be represented. Usually these pixels will be
black and white, but there is no official statement on this, which means
that is possible for some systems to use different colors, such as green
over black.
</p>
<p>CHIP-8 also has a 16 keys keyboard, as indicated in <a href="#Using-the-emulator">Using the emulator</a>.
It also has a buzzer that can play sounds on a particular and single frequency.
</p>
<p>Talking about the interpreter, the CHIP-8 specification sets 34 instructions
that can manipulate the data in memory, registers and stack, and interact with
other IO devices such as sending images to the screen, reading keys from the
keyboard or making the speaker buzz.

<h3 class="section">3.2 SUPERCHIP platform</h3>

<p>SUPERCHIP is an extension over the original CHIP-8 specification that
appeared in the early 90s in order to run CHIP-8 games in some graphical
calculators. Thanks to the new hardware capabilities of the machine, this
specification adds the following features to CHIP-8:
</p>
<ul>
<li> A new graphical mode. By default the emulator runs in compatibility
    mode in order to play old games that do not support the new mode, but
    a new mode can be enabled that has a 128x64 monochrome display, with up
    to 4 times more pixels to display.
</li><li> Instructions for scrolling the screen into different directions, making
    faster some operations that rely on this, such as letting the user see
    more parts of a big screen.
</li><li> Interaction with the underlying operating system that runs the
    SUPERCHIP emulator. For the first time, it is possible to stop the
    emulation without having to close the emulator. Plus, it is possible to
    receive input from the operating system and send output to the operating
    system using a new register bank called <em>R</em>, whose values can be
    provided before running the game, and requested after finishing the game.
</li></ul>

<p>There are 10 new instructions that cna be used in the programs. SUPERCHIP is
still compatible with the original instruction set because these new opcodes
are mapped to opcodes that would trigger on a crash on regular CHIP-8
emulators. A classic ROM can still work because the original instruction
set is, of course, provided.

<p><strong>This mode is not implemented yet in this emulator, although their
features makes this platform very appealing</strong>.
</p>
<p>MEGACHIP is a new format born after the improvement of personal computers.
Old limitations have no place on regular devices we have today, and therefore
we can have better multimedia capabilities for running games.
</p>
<p>MEGACHIP adds support for the following features, that should be designed to
be backwards compatible with CHIP-8 and SUPERCHIP formats:
</p>
<ul>
<li> 256x192 raster resolution.
</li><li> For the first time, multiple colors using an indexed 256 color palette.
</li><li> Up to 32 MB of RAM.
</li><li> 8 bit digital sound.
</li></ul>

<p>There are 11 new instructions that are of course mapped to opcodes that neither
CHIP-8 nor SUPERCHIP uses. Therefore, it is possible to run old CHIP-8 and
SUPERCHIP games without side effects.

<h2 class="chapter">4 Compatible ROM formats</h2>

<p>In order to run the programs, it is required to have a ROM containing the
instructions for the program. These instructions are executed by the virtual
machine when the emulator starts.
</p>
<p>This CHIP-8 distribution comes with a set of public domain ROMs that can be
executed in order to test the features of the emulator. These ROMs are in the
<samp>examples/</samp> directory for the software distribution package, and once
installed they are placed in <samp>/usr/local/share/doc/chip8/roms</samp>, although
the exact location may change depending on where is the package installed in.
</p>
<p>The user can also create new ROMs using software tools or manually writing
machine code into a binary file or an hexadecimal file. These files have to be
provided as parameters when starting the emulator, as explained in
<a href="#Running-the-emulator">Running the emulator</a>.
</p>
<p>However, there are two ways of storing the program instructions inside CHIP-8
ROMs.

<a name="Binary-ROM-files-1"></a>
<h3 class="section">4.1 Binary ROM files</h3>

<p>A binary ROM file is a file where every byte is a byte that must be placed
in the RAM memory for the emulator when the game starts. In other words,
the actual opcodes are encoded. Every 2 bytes in the ROM file can be translated
to an actual instruction that the machine must run. (Or to some data such as
an sprite).
</p>
<p>This is the fastest way for starting ROMs because no transformation is needed.
As the emulator starts, the contents of the file are loaded in RAM memory
if they fit, and the game is started. However, they need special software,
such as hexadecimal editors, in order to see the contents, because they are
binary and cannot be opened with regular text editors.
</p>
<p>As an example, let&rsquo;s suppose that we have a binary ROM with the following
contents, that we might have got using an hexadecimal file tool such as
<code>hexdump</code>:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">$ hexdump examples/PONG
0000 6a 02 6b 0c 6c 3f 6d 0c a2 ea da b6 dc d6 6e 00
0010 22 d4 66 03 68 02 60 60 f0 15 f0 07 30 00 12 1a
</pre></div>

<p>(more lines have been omitted for brevity)
</p>
<p>When this ROM is loaded into memory, the first instruction that will be
executed will be <code>6A02</code>, as these are the first two bytes in the file.
Next, the instruction <code>6B0C</code> will be executed, and then <code>6C3F</code>,
and so.
</p>
<p>Binary format is the most preferred way when working with dumps coming from
external sources such as actual chips containing programs for old computers
using the CHIP-8 format, because they represent the program as it was.

<h3 class="section">4.2 Hexadecimal ROM files</h3>

<p>An hexadecimal ROM file has the hexadecimal characters that are required for
running a ROM file, organized in a text file that can be edited by the user
in order to build their own programs and games.
</p>
<p>It is a file that makes use of a human readable character encoding such as
US-ASCII, UTF-8 or Windows-1252 and that contains only characters in the ranges
<em>&quot;0&quot;</em> to <em>&quot;9&quot;</em>, <em>&quot;A&quot;</em> to <em>&quot;F&quot;</em> and <em>&quot;a&quot;</em> to <em>&quot;f</em>.
These ranges would equal to the US-ASCII codes <code>0x30</code>-<code>0x39</code>,
<code>0x41</code>-<code>0x46</code> and <code>0x61</code>-<code>0x66</code>.
</p>
<p>The contents for an hexadecimal ROM file can be inspected using regular text
editors, as an example:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">$ cat pong.hex
6A026B0C6C3F6D0CA2EADAB6DCD66E0022D46603
68026060F015F0073000121AC717770869FFA2F0

46021278463F1282471F69FF47006901D671122A
</pre></div>

<p>When an hexadecimal ROM file is given to the emulator, it must be processed.
The hexadecimal ROM is converted to binary using the following method:
</p>
<ul>
<li> It ignores any whitespace or line break.
</li><li> It reads the characters 2 by 2.
</li><li> For every pair of characters that should represent hexadecimal characters
    (meaning that they should match the regular expresion
    <code>([0-9A-Fa-f]{2})</code>, the following operation is made:
    <code>(L, R) -&gt; (L &lt;&lt; 4) | R</code>, where L is the left hexadecimal character
    once converted to binary and R is the right hexadecimal character once
    converted to binary. This conversion is made by transforming every
    character to the 4-bit digit they represent (<code>0x0</code> to <code>0xF</code>).
</li></ul>

<p>Although it has not been implemented yet, the following operations are
planned:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Ignore also tabs, in order to ignore any kind of whitespace.
</li><li> Allow comments in hexadecimal ROM files to make it easier to people to
    know what code snippets should do.
</li></ul>

<h3 class="section">4.3 Corrupt ROM files</h3>

<p>This emulator has not been tested against fuzz testing, which means that it is
not possible to know at this moment what should happen and how should the
emulator behave when ROMs having corrupt instructions are execute.
</p>
<p>Fuzz testing is made by giving a random input to a program. As an example,
randomly generating about 100 to 200 bytes of instructions, either in binary
or hexadecimal way, and loading the contents in order to check what happens.
</p>
<p>Even though it has not been tested, the expected behaviour should be:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Glitches on the screen.
</li><li> Weird behaviour of the program.
</li><li> Keyboard delays where they shouldn&rsquo;t be.
</li><li> Sound, if available, playing through the speaker.
</li></ul>

<p>Anyway, it is not expected that a corrupt ROM could harm the host machine in
anyway, becuase none of the operations execcuted by the program interact with
the underlying operating system in a way that could have side effects. On
the other side, all the operations that work with memory buffers make enough
tests to minimize the risk of a buffer overflow error.
</p>
<p>Despite all of that, this is something that hasn&rsquo;t been further tested.
As stated by the license terms of this sfotware, available in the COPYING file,
the emulator is provided AS IS, with no extra warranties.

</p>
<ul>
<li> Line width is limited to 80 characters.
</li><li> Indent uses 4 spaces. No tabs, no 8 spaces, no 2 spaces.
</li><li> Functions should be defined by keeping the datatype in a different
    line than the function name and parameters. Check the source code for
    an example.
</li><li> Parameters and variables should have a easy to understand name. Some
    short names are allowed when by context is clear, such as using <code>P</code>,
    <code>X</code>, <code>Y</code> or <code>K</code> for variables related to an opcode, because
    these are the names given to the opcode structures. Long names when they
    are not required is not pretty.
</li><li> Comments should be added when neccesary. Don&rsquo;t comment every line, but
    don&rsquo;t add long chunks of code with no clear explanation of what they do.
</li><li> Long functions should be split in multiple small functions to make
    the development easier, plus to make testing easier whenever there are
    functions that should be tested.

</div>
<a name="Opcodes-table-1"></a>
<h3 class="section">A.3 Opcodes table</h3>

<p>In order to implement the opcodes, the following structure has been made.
</p>
<p>There is a common definition for every opcode function in the code, declared
as a type named <code>opcode_table_t</code>, located as a private <em>typedef</em>
in the file <samp>cpu.c</samp> at the <em>lib8</em> subproject.
</p>
<p>After that, 16 functions are declared, every one compatible with that typedef.
Their names are <code>nibble_0</code>, <code>nibble_1</code>, <code>nibble_2</code>... These
functions have been declared as private functions using the same parameters:
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">static void
nibble_0(struct machine_t* cpu, word opcode);

static void
nibble_1(struct machine_t* cpu, word opcode);

static void
nibble_2(struct machine_t* cpu, word opcode);
</pre>
<p>Every one of these functions executes opcodes with a P value matching the one
in the function name. As an example, the opcode <code>6104</code> would be executed
by <code>nibble_6</code>, since <strong>P(6104) = 6</strong>.
</p>
<p>Then, there is an array pointing to every opcode function named
<code>nibbles[]</code>. These functions are sorted by P value, so that
<code>nibbles[6]</code> will return a pointer to the function <code>nibble_6</code>,
and <code>nibbles[0xB]</code> will return a pointer to the function
<code>nibble_B</code>.
</p>
<p>Thanks to this indirection, the processing logic for an opcode is easier
since no big switch is required on code. Using this indirection, it is
more straightforward to know which function should process each opcode.
Although, some functions such as <code>nibble_6</code> will make use of switch
anyway since there are multiple opcodes sharing the same P value.

<li> PREAMBLE

<p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document <em>free</em> in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.
</p>
<p>This License is a kind of &ldquo;copyleft&rdquo;, which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.
</p>
<p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
</p>
</li><li> APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

<p>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The &ldquo;Document&rdquo;, below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;.  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.
</p>
<p>A &ldquo;Modified Version&rdquo; of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.
</p>
<p>A &ldquo;Secondary Section&rdquo; is a named appendix or a front-matter section
of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document&rsquo;s overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Invariant Sections&rdquo; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Cover Texts&rdquo; are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
</p>
<p>A &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; is called &ldquo;Opaque&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
<small>ASCII</small> without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
format, <acronym>SGML</acronym> or <acronym>XML</acronym> using a publicly available
<acronym>DTD</acronym>, and standard-conforming simple <acronym>HTML</acronym>,
PostScript or <acronym>PDF</acronym> designed for human modification.  Examples
of transparent image formats include <acronym>PNG</acronym>, <acronym>XCF</acronym> and
<acronym>JPG</acronym>.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be
read and edited only by proprietary word processors, <acronym>SGML</acronym> or
<acronym>XML</acronym> for which the <acronym>DTD</acronym> and/or processing tools are
not generally available, and the machine-generated <acronym>HTML</acronym>,
PostScript or <acronym>PDF</acronym> produced by some word processors for
output purposes only.
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work&rsquo;s title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;publisher&rdquo; means any person or entity that distributes copies
of the Document to the public.
</p>
<p>A section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;.)  To &ldquo;Preserve the Title&rdquo;
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; according to this definition.
</p>
<p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.
</p>
</li><li> VERBATIM COPYING

<p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
</p>
<p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.
</p>
</li><li> COPYING IN QUANTITY

<p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document&rsquo;s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.
</p>
<p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.
</p>
<p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.
</p>
<p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
</p>
</li><li> MODIFICATIONS

<p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
</p>
<ol>
<li> Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

</li><li> List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
unless they release you from this requirement.

</li><li> State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher.

</li><li> Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

</li><li> Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
adjacent to the other copyright notices.

</li><li> Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

</li><li> Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document&rsquo;s license notice.

</li><li> Include an unaltered copy of this License.

</li><li> Preserve the section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;, Preserve its Title, and add
to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
there is no section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo; in the Document, create one
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.

</li><li> Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
it was based on.  These may be placed in the &ldquo;History&rdquo; section.
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

</li><li> For any section Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, Preserve
the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the
substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
dedications given therein.

</li><li> Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

</li><li> Delete any section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;.  Such a section
may not be included in the Modified Version.

</li><li> Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo; or
to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

</li><li> Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
</li></ol>

<p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version&rsquo;s license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
</p>
<p>You may add a section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties&mdash;for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.
</p>
<p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
</p>
<p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
</p>
</li><li> COMBINING DOCUMENTS

<p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.
</p>
<p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
</p>
<p>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
&ldquo;History&rdquo;; likewise combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
and any sections Entitled &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;.  You must delete all
sections Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements.&rdquo;
</p>
</li><li> COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

<p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
</p>
<p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.
</p>
</li><li> AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

<p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an &ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation&rsquo;s users beyond what the individual works permit.
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.
</p>
<p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document&rsquo;s Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.
</p>
</li><li> TRANSLATION

<p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.
</p>
<p>If a section in the Document is Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.
</p>
</li><li> TERMINATION

<p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
</p>
<p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.
</p>
<p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.
</p>
<p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.
</p>
</li><li> FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

<p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</a>.
</p>
<p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo; applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
License can be used, that proxy&rsquo;s public statement of acceptance of a
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
Document.
</p>
</li><li> RELICENSING

<p>&ldquo;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site&rdquo; (or &ldquo;MMC Site&rdquo;) means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
&ldquo;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration&rdquo; (or &ldquo;MMC&rdquo;) contained in the
site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
site.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;CC-BY-SA&rdquo; means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
published by that same organization.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Incorporate&rdquo; means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
in part, as part of another Document.
</p>
<p>An MMC is &ldquo;eligible for relicensing&rdquo; if it is licensed under this
License, and if all works that were first published under this License
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole
or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections,
and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.
</p>
<p>The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

<a name="ADDENDUM_003a-How-to-use-this-License-for-your-documents"></a>
<h3 class="heading">ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents</h3>

<p>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">  Copyright (C)  <var>year</var>  <var>your name</var>.
  Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
  under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
  or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
  with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
  Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
  Free Documentation License''.
</pre></div>

<p>If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the &ldquo;with&hellip;Texts.&rdquo; line with this:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">    with the Invariant Sections being <var>list their titles</var>, with
    the Front-Cover Texts being <var>list</var>, and with the Back-Cover Texts
    being <var>list</var>.
</pre></div>

<p>If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.
</p>
<p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.
