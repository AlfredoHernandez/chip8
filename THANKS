chip8 Thanks file

This emulator is develoepd and maintained by Dani Rodríguez and maybe other
authors described in AUTHORS file. However, many people have further
contributed to this project by reporting problems, suggesting improovements
or sending source code. Here is a list that I'm trying to keep up to date.

* Hugo Martin <hugomartin89@gmail.com>

Aditionally, since this project was built as part of a streaming series on
my YouTube channel, I would like to thank to the audience that has been
following this project since its birth. Here is a list with those people
that have been following the project on YouTube. I try to keep this list
up to date, but there are already so many hours or recorded video that I
haven't completely reviewed all the comments so I may have skipped some
names. Drop me a line if you miss your YouTube alias here. Also, if instead
you don't want to see your YouTube alias here, drop me a line too and I'll
remove your name from this list. This list is sorted alphabetically.

* aitor killer.
* ArcRoaR.
* Iovictor29.

* JoacoGamer100.
* Luis Perez.
* Marcos Sanchess
* Matías.
