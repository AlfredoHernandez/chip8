Reporting bugs.-

    If you find a bug on the emulator, you can report it at the issue
    tracker for this project, which is located on GitHub, at

        http://github.com/danirod/chip8

    Please, only report bugs that can be reproduced. Report the steps
    required to reproduce the bug, as well as the environment (operating
    system, processor) you are running the emulator in. If you are
    able to tell which ROM you were playing when the bug popped out
    that would be better too.
