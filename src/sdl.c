     * This code simulates exception treatment in C using `goto`.
     * This is actually one of the clever situations where I think that
     * `goto` comes handy and where I'm not against it. I'm not an
     * enlightened supporter for `goto` either but I'm fed up with those
     * jerks that just overly repeat "goto is bad" because somebody told
     * them some time ago without even considering it. Of course I wouldn't
     * use `goto` where any other structure goes better, but if you are
     * very conscious on what you do and it makes a more concise syntax,
     * why not. Of course, if you are on your first year of programming
     * you should avoid `goto` until you are strong on structure programming.
     *
     * In this context, I need to call a set of SDL functions that are
     * chained: eg, the return of one function is the parameter of the next.
     * And I need to rollback those functions if any of them cracks.
     * My Exception Treatment Table at the bottom of this function rollbacks
     * everything and it has labels before every rollback function. If any
     * SDL function fails it just has to jump to the appropiate label and
     * start rollbacking from that entrypoint.
